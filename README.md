# JWT FullStack Project Example

## What is this?
Great question, let me start with why I made this project. 
I started learning Vue.JS and everything was going great, I was connecting to external API's to build a couple test projects but I knew I would want to create my own API's with ASP.NET Core. 
These API's I'll be creating aren't just for little test products, I want to have these websites hosted so I can showcase them off on my portfolio (link). 
Since these are production API's and will have CRUD operations I need to constrict who can do certain actions such as updating a record. I did some research and found about JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
So quickly I start to make a solution and not too long after it was done. 
Great right? Kind of, the whole point of this project was to make a template I can use across all of my websites. 
I wanted consitency across all of my backend API's, the ability to easily spin up a new website without having to focus on authentication or autherization, and learn about some of the best practices in the industry.
Once again, I did more research. I had heard about Command Query Responsibility Segrationg (CQRS)
